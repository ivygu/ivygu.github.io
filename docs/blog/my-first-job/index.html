  "articleBody": "Vibrant tents lined the midway grounds, each decorated with heaps of stuffed toys. In search of fun, wandering crowds bounced along to lively jingles. It was a Torontonian farewell to summer—the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE). Besides the dazzling merry-go-rounds and the notorious sticks of deep-fried butter, my fond memories of the CNE date back to the summer after ninth grade. At the age of 15, I sought my first job.\nCanadian National Exhibition - Toronto, Ontario circa 2018 | Photo Credits: Nikki Guo\nUpon scouring the abyss of job postings, the title, game attendant, stood out to me. Game attendant—the epitome of charisma; I envisioned the type of person who allured strangers through powerful pitching and a beaming smile. Immediately, I knew the job description did not align with the perceptions held of me. It is assumed that I am quiet and dismissive; I am shy and cannot present well. How could I, a complete contradiction, be a fit for this role? Nonetheless, I applied, scoring the job later that afternoon.\nI saw my job as an opportunity to shatter these perceptions. No longer did I want to be confined by my world of shyness or restrained by my fear of judgment. If I could step just a bit further outside my comfort zone, that would be enough. So, I stacked a trio of cups, excited yet anxious to commence my days as a game attendant.\nAt my booth, it was a one-person show. Each day, I gave hundreds of mini-presentations to strangers, pitching their chance to win the grand prize—a child-sized dirt bike. All they had to do was knock down a pyramid of stacked cups. Adding onto my never-ending bucket of challenges, for the first time in my life, I was separated from my twin sister. In true twin spirit, we worked at competing companies. This level of personal autonomy, though a first for me, paved the way for my growth as an individual.\nInitially, with no microphones to rely on, my pitching drowned into the sea of music and chatter. That first day, a customer approached me out of pity. Inquiring about my game, they told me to speak up as they could not hear me. Embarrassed, I felt that I was trapped within the perceptions and my ability to improve was static. Among seasoned, traveling game attendants who thrived socially, high school dropouts I met at my lunch break, and university students saving for fall’s tuition payments, there I was, a 15-year-old, who was horrible at her first job.\nHowever, an experienced coworker advised me to not stress about it. With practice and the desire to create memories for visitors, my voice will be heard. He was right. Over the next two weeks, I learned the art of persuasion, navigating my way through small talk and observing body language to catch my next customer. Curious carnival-goers became lingering crowds as I orchestrated excitement and anticipation. Warm smiles and roaring laughter at the CNE filled my summer. However, no day went by without rejection. Facing rejection after rejection from strangers, I slowly familiarized myself with risk-taking. In fact, one rainy day, I had no customers at all. I realized that I did not need to seek validation from others—it was no big deal. In any journey worth taking, there will be rainy days. Despite the overcast of uncertainty, however, I choose to see the world with an optimistic lens, knowing that better days are yet to come. There is hope.\nNow, at 18-years-old, I see how this experience shaped my open-mindedness. Rooting from the fear of talking to strangers, I developed strong communication skills and the ability to persuade. I speak up. In each challenge, I use the same persistence and the same belief that I can achieve whatever I put my mind to. I take risks to broaden my horizons because growth only stems from discomfort. It is the journey through the unknown that takes us to the next level. From there, limits are redefined. All of these values and skills will be an asset to my aspirations of becoming an entrepreneur.\nAs with any carnival game, people questioned whether my game was a scam. They wanted me to prove that the stack of cups was not attached to the table. Alongside all their doubts, I would strike the cups, making them drop to the ground. Although my days as a game attendant have ended, I continue to knock down perceptions, proving to myself that I define my own abilities.\n",
