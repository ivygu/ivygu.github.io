  "articleBody": "TW: Mentions of depression, anxiety \u0026 suicidal ideation\nThis is my story I struggle with my mental health. This past year has been especially difficult for me; I was diagnosed with major depression and endured multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. When I took a year off from university to focus on recovery, I felt the stigma surrounding mental illness. I felt ashamed to admit that I was struggling, and above all, I felt alone.\nNow, in partial remission, I want to create a safe space to start the conversation on mental health. I want to spread the message that it is okay to struggle, it is okay to not be okay, and it is okay to seek help. I am ready to build on my lived experiences to advocate for mental health so that no one feels alone on their journey towards mental wellness.\nThat journey for me started last August.\nSomething was wrong I was so excited to attend McGill University this fall. I was extremely eager to move into my dorm, make new friends, join design teams, and immerse myself in academia. However, on the expressway to Montreal, I literally could not stop crying (listening to Olivia Rodrigo’s album, Sour on repeat of course…). So what happened?\nPainting of highway 401 on route to Montreal. Yes, this painting is actually in colour!\nRiding the metro back home, I remember sobbing my eyes out. There was no particular reason why I was crying other than despair and in general, the sheer hopelessness I felt. I felt alone and all I could see through my tears were the apathetic stares of strangers watching me cry my eyes out. Really embarrassing right? I had just moved to Montreal to start my undergraduate studies and there I was falling apart. At the time, I didn’t know the signs of depression… The loss of interest in life. The fatigue. The negative thought patterns. Yes, all of the package deal that depression has to offer.\nAs weeks passed by, I fell behind.

I was struggling when it seemed like everyone else was thriving. I no longer felt like myself. From there on, I was in and out of the hospital every month or so. I become a regular patient to the extent that the doctors and nurses recognized me each time. I had several severe panic attacks for the first time in my life. Yes, the hospital food was decent (I got accustomed to the taste). No, it wasn’t entirely a depressing experience.\nAt the hospital, fellow patients shared their worries, past traumas, and life experiences with me. Through these conversations, I developed a deeper appreciation for active listening — when, even amongst strangers, a raw human connection can blossom. Furthermore, painting saved my life. Every day I would paint monochromatic pieces of nature, people, etc.\nPainting, Blank Stares - when you don’t know how answer people’s questions…\nMy experience with depression As someone who struggles with depression, I also learned that I can find meaning in my hardship by sharing my story. One of my friends asked me what depression feels like. Of course depression is a different experience for each person, but here’s how it feels to me.\nHow does it feel when all the doors are closed against you? It’s trying to keep it together when the world feels heavy on your shoulders. It’s breaking down into a million pieces, shattering over everything you once loved. The world carries on while you lay there, rigid and helpless. In the dark hole of depression, you hide beneath the oversized coat of melancholy, with the sparse rays of bliss that only scar your skin. Life feels desaturated. Spiraling into negativity, this becomes your new normal. When you tumble into that deep hole, nothing feels worthwhile. It feels as though it will never get better.\nThat’s what it feels like to me.\nTo this day, I still have my ups and downs, though not as drastic. With the combination of psychotherapy and a cocktail mix of psychiatric medications, I’ve been able to recover and enjoy life once again. I’m forever grateful for my family, friends, and supporters who helped me get through this rough patch of my life. Thank you! :D\nI’m proud to say that this coming academic year, I will be a Jack Talks speaker at Jack.org (a youth mental health organization), a peer supporter at the McGill Peer Support Centre, and a volunteer listener at an active listening phone line. This is how I want to give back.\nKey realizations While I did delay my graduation date by one year, I discovered so much more about myself. A year off doesn’t make a difference in the grand scheme of things. Mental health is so important. Prioritize your health above all. I can’t stress this enough. It took me a while to accept that school and work could wait, but for me, that meant the difference between life and death.\nThrough this experience, I now know I would like to combine healthcare and technology and perhaps become a psychiatrist later down the line.\nI realized that we aren’t taught how to support others struggling with mental health. Lots of people did not know what to say to me – they didn’t know how to support me and to be honest, if I were in their position, I wouldn’t have known what to say to myself either. In general, I realized that the more we talk about mental health, the better we can be there for each other. We all have mental health, so why don’t we talk about it? Start the conversation and check in on your peers. Even just a “hey, how are you really doing” can make all the difference!\nMental health is complex, but being vulnerable and authentic about our experiences and wellbeing can spark the change we need to see. Check out Mental Health Commission of Canada for more information about mental health.\nIf you are struggling with your mental health and just need someone to talk to, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me at ig.ivyguo@gmail.com. I’ll be there for you.\n",
